# Conway-s-Game-of-Life
Conway's Game of Life, also known as Game of Life or simply Life, is a cellular automata devised by the British mathematician John H. Conway in 1970. The importance of Life to the fields of Computer Science and Mathematics cannot be understated. It's a programmer's classic that has been programmed to legendary status with it's countless iterations, implementations etc. Conway's Game of Life represents a beginner's gateway into the complex topic of Cellular Automata in Automata Theory.
# Implementation in the C programming language
Since the C programming language does not have a pre-installed graphics library, it is up to the programmer's imagination to visualize something so inherently visually marvellous as life itself.
Most of the implementations in C (almost all) are done using 2D arrays. In this mini-project, I demonstrate an alternative approach by using other data structures, such as a doubly linked list, to simulate the Game of Life.
